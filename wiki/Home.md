## What It Does

- Uploads add-on ZIP files.
- Detects the real add-on folder from `addon.setup.php`.
- Extracts packages into the active ExpressionEngine add-ons directory.
- Shows detected add-ons as cards with install state.
- Links to ExpressionEngine install, update, uninstall, settings, and download actions.

ExpressionEngine remains responsible for the final add-on lifecycle actions.
